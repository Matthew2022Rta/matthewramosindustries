    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Matthew Ramos—a hands-on builder, creative thinker, and aspiring computer scientist currently studying at New York University. I grew up in Elmhurst, Queens, where my curiosity took shape through toys made from duct tape and hours spent engineering with LEGOs. That same inventive spirit still drives me today, whether I’m building a flamethrower, restoring an Acura TL, or developing machine learning models. My work spans a range of disciplines—from carpentry and automotive repair to software development and engineering design. I’ve restored homes, designed foldable skateboards, built electric guitars from shovels, and trained computer vision models. Whether it’s physical fabrication or coding complex systems, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technical precision. Outside the workshop and classroom, I enjoy snowboarding, longboarding, working on cars, sewing, and exploring how things work. My portfolio reflects my passion for learning through doing, solving real-world problems, and building things that are both functional and meaningful.</p>

  <h2>Space Monkey — Retro-Inspired Arcade Game</h2>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> May 2025 – June 2025</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Elmhurst, NY</p>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>
  Space Monkey is a browser-based, multi-level arcade game built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — inspired by retro classics such as Galaxian, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Frogger, Space Invaders, and Breakout. Developed without any game engines or frameworks, the project demonstrates advanced DOM manipulation, game loop architecture, and full interactive design. The game was deployed on a personal website as part of a larger retro arcade suite.
